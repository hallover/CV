I am an undergraduate at Brigham Young University studying Applied Physics with an emphasis in solid state physics. I joined the Materials Simulation Group (MSG) in fall of 2016 after Dr. Gus Hart presented the group's research in Physcs 191. I was immediatly drawn to the project and their drive to change the world through their research. During my time in the group I have: developed programming skills in Python, C++, Julia, and Mathematica, learned good coding practices, and learned how to work efficiently in a team setting, collaborating to find solutions to important problems. 

Projects
---------- 
**Two-Step Method for Accelerating DFT Calculations using Pre-Generated Charge Densities:**


*Abstract:*
Density Functional Theory packages give us the tools we need to discover new alloys. Unfortunately, the process is very slow. Using a sparse integration grid, we can easily compute the charge density of an alloy, which is then frozen and passed to a much denser grid. By freezing the charge density we hope to accelerate the calculations without sacrificing accuracy by bypassing the more computationally intensive processes of denser grids.

* [Context](https://github.com/hallover/alloy-database/blob/master/Context.ipynb) is an interactive ipython noteboook with walks throughs and explanations of my methodology.

* [Results](https://github.com/hallover/alloy-database/blob/master/RESULTS.ipynb) reviews current progress and or results and what my work has contributed.


**Sounding Rocket Simulator**:
This program is a simple simulator to use alongside other popular rocket simulators like OpenRocket and RockSim. It will plot altitude, velocity, acceleration, and drag forces from liftoff to landing. Events such as motor burnout, apogee, and chute deployment are recorded, and other features are on their way.
